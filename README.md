# Solving-8-puzzle-A-star-

A star Algorithm solving an 8 puzzle for my Artificial Intelligence module.

It includes just one file: 
- Astar.py

To run it:
-Download the code.
* Open Terminal and cd into the directory where the file is located.
-Type on your terminal "python Astar.py" or "python3 Astar.py".
-This code will solve any user input grid with a Manhattan heuristic or a Misplaced heuristic (user's choice). Make sure that the input are random integers between 0-8 (can't repeat an integer once used) with a gap between all numbers. 
 For example: 7 2 4 5 0 6 8 3 1
